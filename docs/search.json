    "text": "Preface\nThis is a “mini-book” that discusses “public AI flywheels”: software meant to enable people to opt-in to contribute data towards “public AI” causes. The goal of this book is to support efforts build a transparent, people-centric data collection ecosystem that supports the evaluation and training of public-benefit AI models. More frankly, this is way to organize some design notes, practical documentation that’s out of scope for a single example projec’s repo, and longer abstract writing on the topic.\nThis document is organized as such:\n\nIn Section 1 (current section), we first we describe how this document is organized and introduce the Public AI Flywheel concept.\n\nSection 1.2 describes “core principles” for a public AI data flywheel\n\nIn Section 2, we discuss one particular implementation of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) opt-in flywheel meant to accompany a “public AI interface” (hosted interface software that hits various endpoints for “public AI models”) that uses a “serverless” app + Git backend approach\n\nThis MVP focuses on collecting two high-signal data types: exports of “good chats” and “fail chats.” This data provides immediate value for model evaluation and, at scale, can be used for fine-tuning. Importantly, collecting a list of good and bad chats is also immediately fun, so contributors can get some value before we reach a threshold of data volume needed to construct a full benchmark or dataset. We expect key ideas discussed in this doc, and concretized in this project, to generalize to other data types.\n\nIn Section 3, we provide details on the data retention policy for the Public AI Flywheel and the data policy for the full public AI interface pipeline: from model endpoints to OpenWebUI interface to flywheel platform.\nIn Section 4, we explore the design space in much more detail, describing many other ways that flywheels could be implemented (with the hope of providing a helpful starting point, but also providing more rationale around our MVP)",

Nvidia gives us this definition: “A data flywheel is a feedback loop where data collected from interactions or processes is used to continuously refine AI models.” Others have also written on data flywheels (see e.g. a number of helpful blogs from Roche and Sasson, Liu and Del Balso.\nWhat is public AI? The public AI network gives us this: AI with\nFor more on the public AI concept, see also Mozilla’s work in this space and several workshop papers and preprints (from RegML 2023 at NeurIPS, CodeML 2025 at ICML).\nOur focus in this mini-book is in building public AI flywheels.In order to achieve public access and accountability, public AI systems must also face some unique challenges around the implementation of data flywheels – they may not be able to do what private orgs can do.\nWe are trying to create a feedback loop to improve AI: but we want to start from a position of accessibility (including providing an accessible explanation of exactly what happens to data) and accountability (so people have real agency over data).\nOf course, it’s worth noting that a given public could deliberate and make a collective decision that they prefer an more “traditional approach” to data. Here, we are taking the stance that it’s best to start from a position of leaning heavily towards an opt-in approach (minimize usage and retention of data; data that is used in the flywheel to train AI should be provided via an opt-in by highly informed users).",

    "section": "1.2 Core Principles",
    "text": "1.2 Core Principles\nTranslating the core principles of public AI to the data flywheel domain (and to data strategy more generally), we aim to adhere to the following non-negotiable principles:\n\nTransparency & Informed Consent: Users must be fully informed about the model, its developer, and the ramifications of their contribution. A detailed FAQ and a clear consent module are required before any data is shared. To some extent, true transparency and informed consent requires to active expenditure of resoures to improve the public’s AI literary. We need systems that really do inform people (luckily, that’s something it seems like AI can be good for).\nUser Control & Data Rights The system must empower users with control over their data, mirroring GDPR principles. This includes the right to access ($Art. 15$), rectify ($Art. 16$), erase ($Art. 17$), and port their data ($Art. 20$). Key exemplar: Mozilla Common Voice).\n\nWe note that user control and data rights sometimes conflict with a “fully open” ethos; we will attempt to mitigate these tensions to the best extent possible!\n\nPrivacy and options for pseudonymity: To the extent possible, we believe it is valuable to offer people to ability to contribute to data flywheel with their “real account” attached (to earn credit and reputation), but also to maintain an option to use “light-auth” system, requiring only an email (or similar) for authentication via passwordless magic links. If users take this approach, public contributions will be attributed to a randomly generated handle (e.g., “silver-badger-81”) to protect people’s identity. However, in our MVP (discussed in the next chapter) a HuggingFace account is required to make contributions, but users can choose to remain anonymous or use a pseudonym for the public data release.\nPurpose Limitation & Licensing: Users must be able to specify their preferences for how their data is used (e.g., for public display and evaluation vs. for model training). This is captured using (new) IETF AI Use Preferences and Creative Commons Preference Signals. We will discuss below how this might extend to other preference signal proposals and/or technical approaches to gating data.\n\nThis is critical for answering a likely FAQ around public AI data – if you succeed in creating actually useful training data or new benchmarks, won’t private labs just immediately use that dat as well?",

Can easily be swapped for a lightweight static site, other modern web tech, etc.\n\nAuthentication: User identity is managed via Auth.js (Next-Auth), using Hugging Face (HF) as the exclusive OAuth provider.

This operation is fast and avoids write conflicts.\n\nHow processing of the “waiting room” works:\n\nA separate, asynchronous script is run on a regular schedule (e.g., as a daily GitHub Action).\nThis script fetches all pending files from the _waiting_room.\nIt validates each contribution and includes a placeholder for future content moderation and PII checks.\nValidated contributions are batched and appended to a final, organized dataset file (e.g., data/2025-08.jsonl). Contributions are further bucketed by license/prefs.\nTo ensure atomicity, all file additions (to the final dataset) and deletions (from the waiting room) are performed in a single commit to the Hugging Face Hub. #todo when scaling, need to consider race conditions around the processing!",

    "text": "2.2 Advantages of a Serverless + Git approach\nA serverless + Git stack keeps the “write path” lightweight for contributors and cheap to operate. Functions spin up on demand and idle to zero, so we can avoid paying for boxes that sit around; the trade-off is cold starts, which are well-documented and can be mitigated with provisioned concurrency when needed.\nOn the “read path,” a static site on a global CDN gives instant distribution and low operational overhead. Pages (e.g., from Cloudflare, something like GitHub Pages, or similar) can read directly from the Git “source of truth” and serve assets from edge locations by default, which is exactly what we want for a browsable leaderboard and dataset browser.\nAdditionally, using the Hub (Git-backed) as the source of truth buys us a public audit trail and first-class versioning semantics. HF’s dataset repos are literally Git + LFS, with revision pinning via commit/tag/branch; storage is backed by object storage and scales. That maps cleanly to our “waiting room → release buckets” workflow and makes it easy to diff changes over time. (relevant HF docs: datasets, storage)\nModeration and PII handling are naturally centralized in the processing step. Because we trigger the write as a small file into a staging path and move it during a scheduled job, we can run filters, de-dup, and attach license/pref metadata before publication without asking contributors to learn tooling.\nBasic safety and access controls are pragmatic at the edge. Cloudflare’s WAF/Bot Management and newer “AI bot” controls give us a reasonable anti-scraping posture for public downloads and pages, even if nothing on the open web is truly copy-proof. Recent product updates explicitly target AI crawlers, with default blocking and challenge flows we can enable. (Cloudflare Docs, WIRED, Business Insider)\nFinally, the “preferences and licenses” story fits the stack. Dataset cards and metadata natively expose a license field and other tags (Hub UI and YAML), and CC licenses give clear obligations (e.g., BY, BY-SA) we can enforce in packaging and docs. That lets us partition releases by license and publish compatibility notes in a way downstream users can actually follow. (Hugging Face, Hugging Face)",

    "section": "2.3 Disadvantages (and what to watch)",
    "text": "2.3 Disadvantages (and what to watch)\nTrust centralizes in the processor. Contributors have to believe the middle layer won’t silently drop or reshape submissions. If/when we introduce event-driven ingestion (queues/streams), we must design for retries and duplicates.\nUX isn’t perfectly “instant.” There’s an inherent gap between a user pressing “share” and seeing their item on the public site, because we run validation and batching. That’s a conscious choice, but we should set expectations and likely provide some kind status expectations.\nOperationally, serverless isn’t “no ops,” it’s “different ops.” Cold starts exist (especially on sporadic paths), API limits are real on the platforms we hit (GitHub has documented ceilings; HF also rate-limits writes/reads even if specifics vary by endpoint), and “pay per use” can surprise us at scale without cost guardrails (see e.g. GitHub Docs, GitHub Docs).\nThere’s also platform coupling to be consider. Using specific hosted CI/CD, serverless runtimes, and hub APIs creates a degree of vendor lock-in; this is a known trade-off in serverless architectures and something we can blunt with portable formats (JSONL), documented exports, and “boring” interfaces (Git). ([CNCF][17])\nCompliance remains non-zero. Deletions across mirrored artifacts (Hub revisions, static site snapshots, downstream forks) take a clear policy and a repeatable playbook. For licenses, we’re responsible for honoring CC obligations in our packaging and comms (e.g., keeping BY attribution fields intact; not mixing BY-SA content into incompatible bundles). CC’s legalcode and guidance make those obligations explicit; our tooling should, too. (Creative Commons)\nNet: Serverless + Git gives us a pragmatic bridge—fast contributor UX, public versioning, cheap distribution—while we invest in moderation, idempotent processors, and clear license lanes. If we communicate the review gap, publish the processor’s rules, and keep escape hatches (export scripts, mirrors), the trade-offs are acceptable for an MVP and refine-able over time.",

We also believe it’s important to communicate to users how the public AI interface differs from e.g. using ChatGPT, Gemini, or AI overviews via search.\nHow this approach answers the above questions:\n\nWhere data lives: Centralized database\nWhen prompted: Proactive (user initiates)\nInformation object: Annotated conversations with structured feedback\nWhen processed: On-submission + pre-publication review\nHow accessed: API + static site with rate limits\nFriction level: Medium (redirect to platform)\nPros: Full control over UX, rich features, easy user management\nCons: High maintenance, single point of failure, trust requirements\nExample Stack: Django/Rails + PostgreSQL, Next.js + MongoDB\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Git/Wiki Platform\n\nWhere data lives: Public repository\nWhen prompted: Proactive (user initiates)\nInformation object: Markdown-formatted conversations\nWhen processed: Pre-submission (user does it) + CI/CD validation\nHow accessed: Direct download via Git + web interface\nFriction level: High (technical knowledge required)\nPros: Maximum transparency, built-in versioning, low cost\nCons: Excludes non-technical users, limited data types\nExample Stack: GitHub/GitLab + CI/CD validation\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Direct Telemetry\n\nWhere data lives: Centralized analytics database\nWhen prompted: Passive (continuous collection)\nInformation object: Simple signals with context IDs\nWhen processed: On-submission (real-time pipeline)\nHow accessed: Aggregated dashboards only (no raw access)\nFriction level: Zero\nPros: Massive scale, unbiased sampling, real-time insights\nCons: Limited richness, privacy concerns, no corrections\nExample Stack: ClickHouse/BigQuery + streaming pipeline\n\n\n\n4.3.4 Hybrid Model\n\nWhere data lives: Centralized database\nWhen prompted: Reactive (triggered by signals)\nInformation object: Signals + optional full conversations\nWhen processed: Signals processed immediately, conversations reviewed\nHow accessed: Public aggregates + gated conversation access\nFriction level: Zero, then low\nPros: Balances volume and quality, efficient targeting\nCons: Complex implementation, two-system maintenance\nExample Stack: Telemetry backend + web app frontend\n\n\n\n4.3.5 Serverless + Git Platform\n\nWhere data lives: Public repository\nWhen prompted: Proactive or reactive\nInformation object: Structured data files (JSON/YAML)\nWhen processed: On-submission via serverless function\nHow accessed: Git access + static site generation\nFriction level: Low (automated complexity)\nPros: Transparency + usability, serverless scaling\nCons: Cold starts, API rate limits, complex error handling\nExample Stack: Vercel/Netlify + GitHub API + Hugging Face Hub\n\n\n\n4.3.6 Federated Learning Model\n\nWhere data lives: User devices (distributed)\nWhen prompted: Passive with consent\nInformation object: Model gradients or aggregated statistics\nWhen processed: Pre-submission (on-device)\nHow accessed: Only aggregated model updates available\nFriction level: Zero after setup\nPros: Maximum privacy, no data transfer, infinite scale\nCons: Complex implementation, limited debugging, device requirements\nExample Stack: Flower/TFF + edge deployment\n\n\n\n4.3.7 Browser Extension (just a data ingestion choice: can be used with various backend choices above)\n\nWhere data lives: Centralized or distributed\nWhen prompted: Proactive or passive\nInformation object: DOM captures, interaction logs, selections\nWhen processed: Pre-submission (client-side) + server validation\nHow accessed: Depends on storage choice\nFriction level: Low after installation\nPros: Cross-platform, rich context, works anywhere\nCons: Browser-specific development, installation barrier\nExample Stack: WebExtensions API + backend API\n\n\n\n4.3.8 P2P Network Model\n\nWhere data lives: Distributed across peer nodes\nWhen prompted: Passive (background sharing)\nInformation object: Torrent-style data chunks\nWhen processed: Pre-submission by contributor + network validation\nHow accessed: P2P client required for full access\nFriction level: Medium (client installation)\nPros: No infrastructure costs, censorship resistant\nCons: Availability issues, complex coordination\nExample Stack: libp2p + BitTorrent protocol + DHT",

    "text": "4.6 Frontier approaches data cooperatives, federated learning, and more\nIn many cases, users may want to have data governed by community organizations (e.g., organized by domain/region/language) that hold rights and decide release cadence, licensing defaults, and benefit policies.\nWe note that because our implementation is built on top of open-source software, communities can easily choose to deploy their own OpenWebUI instance and their own data flywheel and effectively operate entirely parallel, self-governed instances. If they also choose to share opt-in data via similar licensing and preference signal approaches, such datasets could be easily merged – but with fine-grained adjustments to precise details (e.g., slight modifications on retention, access, release cadence, content moderation, adn so on.) Of course, data co-ops may choose to use quite different technical stacks. This approach is just one among many.\nIt may be possible to also move from an opt-in data flywheel approach to a federated learning-first approach. Here, model training occurs across user or institutional nodes; only gradients/updates (with privacy tech) are centralized. The dataset remains partitioned or local; central custodian minimized. This approach would:\n\nReduces central data custody and breach surface\nAligns with data-residency and institutional constraints\nEnables “learning from data that can’t leave”\n\nBut has some major downsides / existing barriers:\n\nHarder reproducibility and data auditability\nComplex privacy stack (secure aggregation, DP, client attestation)\nBenchmarking must be redesigned (federated eval)\n\nThis is a bigger leap, but we believe it’s important to begin to think about how the implementation of the Public AI Data Flywheels might support communities wishing to transition towards an FL approach.\nOne rough sketch might look like: * Build the MVP defined in Chapter 2 * Ship license + AI-preference metadata (MVP). * Maintain gated HF releases and public leaderboards/full data access. * Publish provider-payload transparency and link to provider terms (no guarantees). * Process deletions via HF mechanisms when possible; keep our mirrors in sync. * Phase 1 — Co-op pilots * Charter one or two community co-ops; define bylaws, scope, and release cadence. * Spin up many instances of interface + flywheel combos (can fork software directly, or use similar approaches) * Establish a concrete sharing / merging plan * And beyond! * Once several independent data communities, are operated, it might be possible to move from lightweight sharing and merging to more serious federation with technical guarantees. Perhaps this might start with federated evaluation and then move to federated training. Much more to do here, out of scope for this document.",

Access requires acceptance of dataset-specific terms (e.g., no re-identification; respect License and AI preferences). 5.2 Static Site. Public access includes anti-scraping measures (WAF/bot management, rate limits, tokenized URLs). Copying cannot be fully prevented; rely on License controls for downstream obligations. 6. Deletions & Takedowns\n6.1 Future-Only Removal. Upon verified request, We will exclude the identified Contribution(s) from future Releases and update mirrors where feasible. Past Releases and third-party copies may persist. 6.2 Hugging Face Workflows. Where possible, We will route or honor takedowns via the Hugging Face repository’s native workflows. 7. Provider Transparency (No Guarantees)\nWe forward prompts to third-party Providers. We display a payload transparency panel and link to Provider terms when available. We do not control Provider retention, training, or other uses of data once sent to them. 8. Privacy; Retention\nRetention and access for telemetry, envelopes, accounts, staging, Releases, and the Static Site are governed by the Data Retention & Contribution Policy (Section 3). That Policy is incorporated by reference. 9. Communications\nBy creating an account or requesting repository access, you may receive administrative emails (e.g., access decisions, policy updates). 10. Disclaimers; Limitation of Liability; Indemnity\nTHE FLYWHEEL AND RELEASES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES (INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT). WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. Our aggregate liability under these Terms will not exceed USD $500 (or the maximum permitted by law if lower). You agree to indemnify Us for third-party claims arising from your Contributions or breach of these Terms. 11. Updates\nWe may update these Terms by posting a new effective date. Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance. 12. Termination\nWe may suspend or terminate access at any time. Contributions included in prior Releases remain available under their Licenses. 13. Governing Law; Venue\nThese Terms are governed by the laws of [LAW & VENUE], without regard to conflict-of-laws rules. Exclusive venue lies in the courts of [VENUE].",
